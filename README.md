# ECMAScript 6 - Making JavaScript Better
This repository contains a presentation and examples for using ES6.

##Description
The ES6 specification introduces a large number of language improvements to Javascript that make it easier to write and understand. This presentation takes a look at the new standard by providing a brief history, reviewing current support, and providing working examples.  Even though this specification is yet to be ratified, it is still possible to begin taking advantage of these language features in your JavaScript projects today.  In fact, many people are already using these new language features in production applications.  The main point of this discussion is to spark interest and encourage other developers to investigate and begin using ES6.

##Examples 
The [examples](examples) found in this presentation have been purposefully designed to be easy to follow and understand.  They have been transpiled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to demonstrate the capabilities of a server side transpiler and to make it easy to run them in any JavaScript engine that supports ES5.
